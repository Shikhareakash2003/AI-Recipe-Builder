Let it marinate for 15-20 minutes while you prepare other ingredients.\n2.  **Heat Oil:** Heat 3 tablespoons of cooking oil in a heavy-bottomed pan or kadai over medium heat.\n3.  **Temper Spices:** Add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom (if using), and cinnamon stick (if using). Let them splutter and become fragrant (about 10-15 seconds).\n4.  **Sauté Onions:** Add the finely chopped onion and sauté until golden brown, stirring frequently (about 7-10 minutes).\n5.  **Add Ginger-Garlic & Green Chillies:** Add the ginger-garlic paste and slit green chillies. Sauté for another 1-2 minutes until the raw smell disappears.\n6.  **Add Ground Spices:** Reduce heat to low. Add the remaining turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and the remaining red chilli powder. Stir for 30 seconds, adding a splash of water if the spices stick to prevent burning.\n7.  **Cook Tomatoes:** Add the tomato puree (or finely chopped tomatoes) and salt to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the oil separates from the masala and the tomatoes are pulpy (about 5-7 minutes).\n8.  **Sear Chicken & Potatoes:** Add the marinated chicken pieces to the pan. Increase heat to medium-high and sear the chicken for 3-4 minutes until it changes colour. Then add the cubed potatoes and mix well with the masala.\n9.  **Simmer Curry:** Add about 1.5 cups of hot water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let it simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken and potatoes are tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.\n10. **Finish:** Once the chicken and potatoes are cooked, stir in the garam masala. Garnish with fresh chopped coriander leaves. Keep covered until serving.\n\n**Part 2: Prepare the Steamed Rice**\n\n1.  **Wash Rice:** Rinse the Basmati rice thoroughly under cold running water until the water runs clear.\n2.  **Cook Rice:**\n    *   **Pot Method:** Combine the washed rice, 1.75 cups of water, and a pinch of salt (optional) in a pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover tightly, and simmer for 12-15 minutes, or until all water is absorbed. Let it rest, covered, for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork.\n    *   **Rice Cooker Method:** Follow your rice cooker's instructions, typically using 1.5 - 2 cups of water per cup of rice.\n\n**Part 3: Prepare the Fresh Rotis**\n\n1.  **Knead Dough:** In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and a pinch of salt. Gradually add water, a little at a time, mixing until a soft, pliable dough forms. Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. Add 1 teaspoon of oil/ghee and knead for another minute. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 15-20 minutes.\n2.  **Divide and Roll:** Divide the dough into 4 equal portions and roll each into a smooth ball. Lightly dust a rolling surface with dry flour. Take one dough ball, press it flat, and roll it out into a thin circle (about 6-7 inches in diameter), dusting with flour as needed to prevent sticking.\n3.  **Cook Rotis:**\n    *   Heat a tawa (flat griddle) over medium-high heat.\n    *   Place the rolled roti onto the hot tawa. Cook for about 30 seconds until small bubbles appear on the surface.\n    *   Flip the roti and cook the other side for another 30-45 seconds, until light brown spots appear.\n    *   **For Puffed Rotis (Optional):** If you have a direct flame, carefully transfer the half-cooked roti directly onto the flame using tongs. It should puff up like a balloon within a few seconds. Flip and cook briefly on the other side.\n    *   **Without Direct Flame:** Press gently around the edges of the roti with a clean cloth or spatula to help it puff on the tawa.\n    *   Remove from the tawa and immediately brush with a tiny bit of ghee (optional) to keep it soft. Stack the cooked rotis in a foil or cloth-lined container to keep them warm.\n    *   Repeat with the remaining dough balls.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Cooking Time:**\n\n*   **Preparation Time:** 20-25 minutes\n*   **Cooking Time:** 50-60 minutes (Curry can simmer while rice and rotis are prepared)\n*   **Total Time:** 70-85 minutes\n\n---\n\n### **Serving Suggestions:**\n\nServe the hot **Dehati Aloo Tamatar Chicken** curry immediately alongside freshly made **Rotis** and steaming hot **Basmati Rice**.\n*   **Accompaniments:** A simple side salad of sliced onions, cucumber, and lemon wedges will add freshness. A dollop of plain yogurt (Dahi) or a spoonful of your favorite Indian pickle (Achar) can also enhance the meal.\n*   **Presentation:** Garnish the curry with extra fresh coriander leaves just before serving.\n\nEnjoy your wholesome and flavorful Indian meal!",
